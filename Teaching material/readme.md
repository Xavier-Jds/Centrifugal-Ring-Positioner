The CRP is currently used as a teaching experimental setup for the laboratory sessions of the Control System Design course at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles.
The aim of these labs is to design and implement a control strategy that meets one or several requirements for a real plant

The file *Control System Design Laboratory Material.pdf* consists of the laboratory statement.

The folder *Matlab codes* contains the different codes that are provided to the students for the labs:
  - *Identification*: code for the identification of a plant model by a black box experiment (uses *IdentifySystem()* and *Cost()* functions)
  - *Control sample*: example of a proportional controller for real-time control of a plant

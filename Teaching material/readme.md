The CRP is currently used as a teaching experimental setup for the laboratory sessions of the Control System Design course at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles.
The aim of these labs is to design and implement a controller which meets one or several requirements for a real plant

The file *Control System Design Laboratory Material.pdf* consists of the laboratory statement.

The folder *Matlab codes* contains the different codes that are provided to the students for the labs:
  - *Acquisition*: code for the acquisition of the data from the plant on Matlab 
  - *Identification*: code for the identification of a plant model by a black box experiment
  - *IdentifySystem()*: function performing the minimization problem for the identification code
  - *Cost*: cost function for the minimization problem
  - *Control sample*: example of a proportional controller for real-time control of a plant

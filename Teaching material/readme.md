The CRP is currently used as a teaching experimental setup for the laboratory sessions of the Control System Design course at the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles.
The aim of these labs is design and implement a controller which meets one or several requirements for a real plant

The file *Control System Design Laboratory Material.pdf* consists of the laboratory statement.
The file *Example_ControlCode.m* consists of an example of a MATLAB code for controlling a plant with a proportionnal controller.

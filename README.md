# Centrifugal-Ring-Positioner

The Centrifugal Ring Positioner (CRP) consists of a novel experimental setup for control engineering teaching. 
It has been developped through a master thesis project of the Department of Control Engineering and System Analysis of the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.

The aim of this repository is to share this novel experimental setup and to provide all the required information and files to reproduce a CRP. 
This work is already reported in "A Project-Based Learning Approach for Building an Affordable Control Teaching Lab: the Centrifugal Ring Positioner", (date + revue).

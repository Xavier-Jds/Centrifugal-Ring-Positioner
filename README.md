# Centrifugal Ring Positioner

The Centrifugal Ring Positioner (CRP) consists of a novel experimental setup for control engineering teaching. 
It has been developed through a master thesis project of the Department of Control Engineering and System Analysis of the Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.

The aim of this repository is to share this novel experimental setup and to provide all the required information and files to reproduce a CRP. 
This work is already reported in "A Project-Based Learning Approach for Building an Affordable Control Teaching Lab: the Centrifugal Ring Positioner", (date + revue).

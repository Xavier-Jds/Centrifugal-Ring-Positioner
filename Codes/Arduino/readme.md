This section contains several Arduino codes used for model identification and control of the CRP. 

  - Control_CRP.ino: cascade control of the CRP with PD or PID outerloop controller
  - Control_velocity_CRP.ino: control (proportional controller) of the angular velocity of the motor
  - OpenLoop_step_motor_CRP.ino: open loop step response of the motor (more information about the identification can be found in the papers)
